    <h3>Who is Uncle Cook?</h3>

</html>

<p> Uncle Cook wasn't always a hawker. He started out as a hotel chef, crafting gourmet meals for high-end guests in Singapore's bustling hospitality scene. But his heart was always in the hawker centres—where the real soul of Singaporean food lives. One rainy afternoon, he decided to leave the polished kitchens behind and chase a dream rooted in nostalgia: recreating the chicken rice his grandmother used to make in their kampong home. With just a second-hand wok, a secret blend of aromatics, and a whole lot of heart, he opened his humble stall at Maxwell Road Food Centre. Word spread fast. Locals were drawn not just to the perfectly poached chicken and fragrant rice cooked in rich broth, but to the warmth of Uncle Cook himself—always smiling, always generous with extra chili. Today, his chicken rice is considered one of Singapore's hidden gems, praised by food critics and adored by regulars who swear it's better than the famous Tian Tian stall.</p>
